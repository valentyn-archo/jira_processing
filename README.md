# Jira Project

## Description

An application was created to retrieve information from jira query and save it in the excel file.

The essence of the project is as follows: 
- it allows user to choose a jira (expedia, homeaway or any other) âœ…; 
- it allows user to extract data from JIRA and write it to excel files such as xlsx âœ…;
- it allows user to add new data in existing xlsx files, while allowing him to select the required fields (components, dates, labels, estimates and more) âœ….

All fields are validated on the UI part ðŸ“‹. 
A project was written on React JS using server-client architecture. Several screenshots of the program were added below.
